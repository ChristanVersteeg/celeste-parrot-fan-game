make a build that can give infinite speed
upgrade paths routes (mutually exclusive)
speed sometimes makes it harder
Maybe some deco ? Or something that tell you in witch chaper you are
make the gaps in old site slightly more lenient at very high speed upgrades
its a little bit tight in some spots, maybe make it with scroll options for how fast it goes?
Procedural generation would be great for replayability, and maybe slightly nerfing the memory section within old site
